### Ingredients

#### Dry
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 1/4 tsp salt

#### Wet
- 1 3/8 cup water
- 1 Tbsp dry activated yeast
- 2 Tbsp sourdough starter (fed at least one day ago)

### Baking

#### Making the dough
1. Mix together dry ingredients in large bowl.
2. Warm up the water to ideally about 100-110° F. Ice-cold or boiling water will kill the yeast, so avoid those extremes.
2. Stir together wet ingredients in smaller bowl until yeast is mostly dissolved, let sit for about five minutes.
3. Pour wet ingredients into dry.
4. Mix with a spoon until it turns into a ball of dough.

#### Letting dough rise
1. Pour a bit of oil into the mixing bowl, roll the dough around in it. This should coat both the dough and the bowl with a thin layer of oil to help prevent dough from sticking.
2. Cover dough with plastic wrap to prevent a crust from forming.
3. Put dough into a closet to rise overnight.

#### Baking the bread
Welcome to tomorrow morning! Your dough should be much larger than it was last night.
1. Pre-heat oven to 500° F.
2. Line Dutch oven with parchment paper, put dough in there.
3. Cover the dutch oven.
3. Bake on middle shelf for 40 mins.
4. Uncover, remove parchment paper, and bake for 4 more minutes.
